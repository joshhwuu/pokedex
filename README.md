### Project Summary:
Our project is a centralized hub of information that allows users to access and contribute
detailed information about the Pokémon video game series. Information about the game’s
Pokémon, trainers, gym leaders, moves, and more are to be tracked so users are able to
develop strategies and keep track of the vast amount of information available in the Pokemon series.
Users should be able to find information such as which trainers possess which Pokémon, what are
the weaknesses or strengths of a type, or which Pokémon can learn certain moves.
